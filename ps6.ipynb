# Discuss the results in a paragraph. Bring up issues including the cause for the truth values being not mostly correct: 

# The results of the system show that 1605 total words were evaluated, with 1077 correct truth value predictions. 
# The proportion of correct predictions was 0.67, and the number of total IDS evaluated was 276. Since there
# were 101 IDs with at least 85% correct predictions, making the proportion of IDS with at least 85% correct predictions 0.37. 
# the 1000.txt file was used to test this system, 80389 transcripts were used. These results also reveal certain issues that 
# caused truth values to not be correct. One of these issues was ambiguity in relation to work substitutions, such as with ânoâ 
# versus ânotâ. One example of this is that the correct sentence âNO T IS MIRRORED AND CENTEREDâ to be incorrectly listed as 
# âNOT T IS MIRRORED AND CENTERED.â While both sentences may parse, this difference leads to an incorrect truth value. 
# A second issue found in this is that there are some grammatical errors that parse despite being incorrect. 
# For instance, sentences such as âSOME VOWELS IS NOT CAPITALâ or âEVERY EVEN LETTER IS THE VOWELâ were parsed. 
# This is another issue that could cause truth values to be not mostly correct.
